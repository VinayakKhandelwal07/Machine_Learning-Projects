Laptop Price Prediction with Flask
Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting laptop prices based on various features and a Flask-based web application that provides an easy-to-use interface for making predictions.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict laptop prices using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to laptops. The prediction results are then presented through a web interface developed with Flask.

Features
Laptop Price Prediction Model: A machine learning model trained to predict laptop prices based on features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and more.
Flask Web Application: A user-friendly web interface where users can input laptop specifications and get a predicted price.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Web Framework: Flask
HTML/CSS: For web page design
Python: For backend logic and model integration
