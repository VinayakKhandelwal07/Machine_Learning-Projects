House Price Prediction with Flask
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict house prices based on various features, and a Flask-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for making predictions.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a machine learning model trained on a dataset with various house features. The predictions are accessible via a web application built with Flask, allowing users to input house details and receive price estimates.

Features
House Price Prediction Model: A machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.
Flask Web Application: A web interface for users to input house details and view the predicted price.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Web Framework: Flask
HTML/CSS: For web page design
Python: For backend logic and model integration
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
